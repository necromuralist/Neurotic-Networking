# ### Overview
# In this assignment, concretely you will: 
# 
# - Learn about Siamese networks
# - Understand how the triplet loss works
# - Understand how to evaluate accuracy
# - Use cosine similarity between the model's outputted vectors
# - Use the data generator to get batches of questions
# - Predict using your own model
# 
# By now, you are familiar with trax and know how to make use of classes to define your model. We will start this homework by asking you to preprocess the data the same way you did in the previous assignments. After processing the data you will build a classifier that will allow you to identify whether to questions are the same or not. 
# <img src = "meme.png" style="width:550px;height:300px;"/>
# 
# 
# You will process the data first and then pad in a similar way you have done in the previous assignment. Your model will take in the two question embeddings, run them through an LSTM, and then compare the outputs of the two sub networks using cosine similarity. Before taking a deep dive into the model, start by importing the data set.

# <a name='1.1'></a>
# ### 1.1 Loading in the data
# 
# You will be using the Quora question answer dataset to build a model that could identify similar questions. This is a useful task because you don't want to have several versions of the same question posted. Several times when teaching I end up responding to similar questions on piazza, or on other community forums. This data set has been labeled for you. Run the cell below to import some of the packages you will be using.

# **Notice that for this assignment Trax's numpy is referred to as `fastnp`, while regular numpy is referred to as `np`.**
# 
# You will now load in the data set. We have done some preprocessing for you. If you have taken the deeplearning specialization, this is a slightly different training method than the one you have seen there. If you have not, then don't worry about it, we will explain everything.

# As explained in the lectures, we select only the question pairs that are duplicate to train the model. <br>
# We build two batches as input for the Siamese network and we assume that question $q1_i$ (question $i$ in the first batch) is a duplicate of $q2_i$ (question $i$ in the second batch), but all other questions in the second batch are not duplicates of $q1_i$.

# Above, you have seen that you only took the duplicated questions for training our model. <br>You did so on purpose, because the data generator will produce batches $([q1_1, q1_2, q1_3, ...]$, $[q2_1, q2_2,q2_3, ...])$  where $q1_i$ and $q2_k$ are duplicate if and only if $i = k$.

# ### 1.3 Understanding the iterator 
# 
# Most of the time in Natural Language Processing, and AI in general we use batches when training our data sets. If you were to use stochastic gradient descent with one example at a time, it will take you forever to build a model. In this example, we show you how you can build a data generator that takes in $Q1$ and $Q2$ and returns a batch of size `batch_size`  in the following format $([q1_1, q1_2, q1_3, ...]$, $[q2_1, q2_2,q2_3, ...])$. The tuple consists of two arrays and each array has `batch_size` questions. Again, $q1_i$ and $q2_i$ are duplicates, but they are not duplicates with any other elements in the batch. 
# 
# <br>
# 
# The command ```next(data_generator)```returns the next batch. This iterator returns the data in a format that you could directly use in your model when computing the feed-forward of your algorithm. This iterator returns a pair of arrays of questions. 
# 
# <a name='ex01'></a>
# ### Exercise 01
# 
# **Instructions:**  
# Implement the data generator below. Here are some things you will need. 
# 
# - While true loop.
# - if `index >= len_Q1`, set the `idx` to $0$.
# - The generator should return shuffled batches of data. To achieve this without modifying the actual question lists, a list containing the indexes of the questions is created. This list can be shuffled and used to get random batches everytime the index is reset.
# - Append elements of $Q1$ and $Q2$ to `input1` and `input2` respectively.
# - if `len(input1) == batch_size`, determine `max_len` as the longest question in `input1` and `input2`. Ceil `max_len` to a power of $2$ (for computation purposes) using the following command:  `max_len = 2**int(np.ceil(np.log2(max_len)))`.
# - Pad every question by `vocab['<PAD>']` until you get the length `max_len`.
# - Use yield to return `input1, input2`. 
# - Don't forget to reset `input1, input2`  to empty arrays at the end (data generator resumes from where it last left).

# # Part 2: Defining the Siamese model
# 
# <a name='2.1'></a>
# 
# ### 2.1 Understanding Siamese Network 
# A Siamese network is a neural network which uses the same weights while working in tandem on two different input vectors to compute comparable output vectors.The Siamese network you are about to implement looks like this:
# 
# <img src = "siamese.png" style="width:600px;height:300px;"/>
# 
# You get the question embedding, run it through an LSTM layer, normalize $v_1$ and $v_2$, and finally use a triplet loss (explained below) to get the corresponding cosine similarity for each pair of questions. As usual, you will start by importing the data set. The triplet loss makes use of a baseline (anchor) input that is compared to a positive (truthy) input and a negative (falsy) input. The distance from the baseline (anchor) input to the positive (truthy) input is minimized, and the distance from the baseline (anchor) input to the negative (falsy) input is maximized. In math equations, you are trying to maximize the following.
# 
# $$\mathcal{L}(A, P, N)=\max \left(\|\mathrm{f}(A)-\mathrm{f}(P)\|^{2}-\|\mathrm{f}(A)-\mathrm{f}(N)\|^{2}+\alpha, 0\right)$$
# 
# $A$ is the anchor input, for example $q1_1$, $P$ the duplicate input, for example, $q2_1$, and $N$ the negative input (the non duplicate question), for example $q2_2$.<br>
# $\alpha$ is a margin; you can think about it as a safety net, or by how much you want to push the duplicates from the non duplicates. 
# <br>
# 
# <a name='ex02'></a>
# ### Exercise 02
# 
# **Instructions:** Implement the `Siamese` function below. You should be using all the objects explained below. 
# 
# To implement this model, you will be using `trax`. Concretely, you will be using the following functions.
# 
# 
# - `tl.Serial`: Combinator that applies layers serially (by function composition) allows you set up the overall structure of the feedforward. [docs](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Serial) / [source code](https://github.com/google/trax/blob/1372b903bb66b0daccee19fd0b1fdf44f659330b/trax/layers/combinators.py#L26)
#     - You can pass in the layers as arguments to `Serial`, separated by commas. 
#     - For example: `tl.Serial(tl.Embeddings(...), tl.Mean(...), tl.Dense(...), tl.LogSoftmax(...))` 
# 
# 
# -  `tl.Embedding`: Maps discrete tokens to vectors. It will have shape (vocabulary length X dimension of output vectors). The dimension of output vectors (also called d_feature) is the number of elements in the word embedding. [docs](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Embedding) / [source code](https://github.com/google/trax/blob/1372b903bb66b0daccee19fd0b1fdf44f659330b/trax/layers/core.py#L113)
#     - `tl.Embedding(vocab_size, d_feature)`.
#     - `vocab_size` is the number of unique words in the given vocabulary.
#     - `d_feature` is the number of elements in the word embedding (some choices for a word embedding size range from 150 to 300, for example).
# 
# 
# -  `tl.LSTM` The LSTM layer. It leverages another Trax layer called [`LSTMCell`](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.rnn.LSTMCell). The number of units should be specified and should match the number of elements in the word embedding. [docs](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.rnn.LSTM) / [source code](https://github.com/google/trax/blob/1372b903bb66b0daccee19fd0b1fdf44f659330b/trax/layers/rnn.py#L87)
#     - `tl.LSTM(n_units)` Builds an LSTM layer of n_units.
#     
#     
# - `tl.Mean`: Computes the mean across a desired axis. Mean uses one tensor axis to form groups of values and replaces each group with the mean value of that group. [docs](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Mean) / [source code](https://github.com/google/trax/blob/1372b903bb66b0daccee19fd0b1fdf44f659330b/trax/layers/core.py#L276)
#     - `tl.Mean(axis=1)` mean over columns.
# 
# 
# - `tl.Fn` Layer with no weights that applies the function f, which should be specified using a lambda syntax. [docs](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.base.Fn) / [source doce](https://github.com/google/trax/blob/70f5364dcaf6ec11aabbd918e5f5e4b0f5bfb995/trax/layers/base.py#L576)
#     - $x$ -> This is used for cosine similarity.
#     - `tl.Fn('Normalize', lambda x: normalize(x))` Returns a layer with no weights that applies the function `f`
#     
#     
# - `tl.parallel`: It is a combinator layer (like `Serial`) that applies a list of layers in parallel to its inputs. [docs](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Parallel) / [source code](https://github.com/google/trax/blob/37aba571a89a8ad86be76a569d0ec4a46bdd8642/trax/layers/combinators.py#L152)

# 
# ### 2.2 Hard  Negative Mining
# 
# 
# You will now implement the `TripletLoss`.<br>
# As explained in the lecture, loss is composed of two terms. One term utilizes the mean of all the non duplicates, the second utilizes the *closest negative*. Our loss expression is then:
#  
# \begin{align}
#  \mathcal{Loss_1(A,P,N)} &=\max \left( -cos(A,P)  + mean_{neg} +\alpha, 0\right) \\
#  \mathcal{Loss_2(A,P,N)} &=\max \left( -cos(A,P)  + closest_{neg} +\alpha, 0\right) \\
# \mathcal{Loss(A,P,N)} &= mean(Loss_1 + Loss_2) \\
# \end{align}
# 
# 
# Further, two sets of instructions are provided. The first set provides a brief description of the task. If that set proves insufficient, a more detailed set can be displayed.  
# 
# <a name='ex03'></a>
# ### Exercise 03
# 
# **Instructions (Brief):** Here is a list of things you should do: <br>
# 
# - As this will be run inside trax, use `fastnp.xyz` when using any `xyz` numpy function
# - Use `fastnp.dot` to calculate the similarity matrix $v_1v_2^T$ of dimension `batch_size` x `batch_size`

# We'll describe the algorithm using a detailed example. Below, V1, V2 are the output of the normalization blocks in our model. Here we will use a batch_size of 4 and a d_model of 3. As explained in lecture, the inputs, Q1, Q2 are arranged so that corresponding inputs are duplicates while non-corresponding entries are not. The outputs will have the same pattern.
# <img src = "C3_W4_triploss1.png" style="width:1021px;height:229px;"/>
# This testcase arranges the outputs, v1,v2, to highlight different scenarios. Here, the first two outputs V1[0], V2[0] match exactly - so the model is generating the same vector for Q1[0] and Q2[0] inputs. The second outputs differ, circled in orange, we set, V2[1] is set to match V2[**2**], simulating a model which is generating very poor results. V1[3] and V2[3] match exactly again while V1[4] and V2[4] are set to be exactly wrong - 180 degrees from each other, circled in blue. 
# 
# The first step is to compute the cosine similarity matrix or `score` in the code. As explained in lecture, this is $$V_1 V_2^T$$ This is generated with `fastnp.dot`.
# <img src = "C3_W4_triploss2.png" style="width:959px;height:236px;"/>
# The clever arrangement of inputs creates the data needed for positive *and* negative examples without having to run all pair-wise combinations. Because Q1[n] is a duplicate of only Q2[n], other combinations are explicitly created negative examples or *Hard Negative* examples. The matrix multiplication efficiently produces the cosine similarity of all positive/negative combinations as shown above on the left side of the diagram. 'Positive' are the results of duplicate examples and 'negative' are the results of explicitly created negative examples. The results for our test case are as expected, V1[0]V2[0] match producing '1' while our other 'positive' cases (in green) don't match well, as was arranged. The V2[2] was set to match V1[3] producing a poor match at `score[2,2]` and an undesired 'negative' case of a '1' shown in grey. 
# 
# With the similarity matrix (`score`) we can begin to implement the loss equations. First, we can extract $$cos(A,P)$$ by utilizing `fastnp.diagonal`. The goal is to grab all the green entries in the diagram above. This is `positive` in the code.
# 
# Next, we will create the *closest_negative*. This is the nonduplicate entry in V2 that is closest (has largest cosine similarity) to an entry in V1. Each row, n, of `score` represents all comparisons of the results of Q1[n] vs Q2[x] within a batch. A specific example in our testcase is row `score[2,:]`. It has the cosine similarity of V1[2] and V2[x]. The *closest_negative*, as was arranged, is V2[2] which has a score of 1. This is the maximum value of the 'negative' entries (blue entries in the diagram).
# 
# To implement this, we need to pick the maximum entry on a row of `score`, ignoring the 'positive'/green entries. To avoid selecting the 'positive'/green entries, we can make them larger negative numbers. Multiply `fastnp.eye(batch_size)` with 2.0 and subtract it out of `scores`. The result is `negative_without_positive`. Now we can use `fastnp.max`, row by row (axis=1), to select the maximum which is `closest_negative`.
# 
# Next, we'll create *mean_negative*. As the name suggests, this is the mean of all the 'negative'/blue values in `score` on a row by row basis. We can use `fastnp.eye(batch_size)` and a constant, this time to create a mask with zeros on the diagonal. Element-wise multiply this with `score` to get just the 'negative values. This is `negative_zero_on_duplicate` in the code. Compute the mean by using `fastnp.sum` on `negative_zero_on_duplicate` for `axis=1` and divide it by `(batch_size - 1)` . This is `mean_negative`.
# 
# Now, we can compute loss using the two equations above and `fastnp.maximum`. This will form `triplet_loss1` and `triplet_loss2`. 
# 
# `triple_loss` is the `fastnp.mean` of the sum of the two individual losses.
# 
# Once you have this code matching the expected results, you can clip out the section between ### START CODE HERE and ### END CODE HERE it out and insert it into TripletLoss below.

# # Part 3: Training

Before, going into the training, we will use a special data set up. We will define the inputs using the data generator we built above. The lambda function acts as a seed to remember the last batch that was given. Run the cell below to get the question pairs inputs.

# ### 3.1 Training the model
# 
# You will now write a function that takes in your model and trains it. To train your model you have to decide how many times you want to iterate over the entire data set; each iteration is defined as an `epoch`. For each epoch, you have to go over all the data, using your training iterator.

# ### Exercise 04
# 
# **Instructions:** Implement the `train_model` below to train the neural network above. Here is a list of things you should do, as already shown in lecture 7: 
# 
# - Create `TrainTask` and `EvalTask`
# - Create the training loop `trax.supervised.training.Loop`
# - Pass in the following depending on the context (train_task or eval_task):
#     - `labeled_data=generator`
#     - `metrics=[TripletLoss()]`,
#     - `loss_layer=TripletLoss()`
#     - `optimizer=trax.optimizers.Adam` with learning rate of 0.01
#     - `lr_schedule=lr_schedule`,
#     - `output_dir=output_dir`

# This routine will run all the test question pairs through the model, compute the cosine simlarity of each pair, threshold it and compare the result to  y_test - the correct response from the data set. The results are accumulated to produce an accuracy.
# 
# 
# <a name='ex05'></a>
# ### Exercise 05
# 
# **Instructions**  
#  - Loop through the incoming data in batch_size chunks
#  - Use the data generator to load q1, q2 a batch at a time. **Don't forget to set shuffle=False!**
#  - copy a batch_size chunk of y into y_test

#  - for each element of the batch
#         - compute the cos similarity of each pair of entries, v1[j],v2[j]
#         - determine if d > threshold
#         - increment accuracy if that result matches the expected results (y_test[j])
#  - compute the final accuracy and return
#  
# Due to some limitations of this environment, running classify multiple times may result in the kernel failing. If that happens *Restart Kernal & clear output* and then run from the top. During development, consider using a smaller set of data to reduce the number of calls to model().

# 
# Siamese networks are important and useful. Many times there are several questions that are already asked in quora, or other platforms and you can use Siamese networks to avoid question duplicates. 
# 
# Congratulations, you have now built a powerful system that can recognize question duplicates. In the next course we will use transformers for machine translation, summarization, question answering, and chatbots.
