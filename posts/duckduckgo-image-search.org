* DuckDuckGo Image Search
This is a post for some notes on the ~ddg_images~ function from the [[https://github.com/deedy5/duckduckgo_search][duckduckgo-search library (link to GitHub)]] which downloads images using duckduckgo (and thus bing in a way).

* The Parameters
Let's start by looking at the arguments that the function takes.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both
from duckduckgo_search import ddg_images

print(ddg_images.__doc__)
#+end_src

#+end_example

Hopefully the arguments are pretty straight forward. I couldn't find an official help page for image searches but they seem pretty straight-forward.

* The Output

Let's do a search for images of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lop_rabbit][lop-eared rabbits]] and then take a look at what ~ddg_images~ returns.

#+begin_src python :results none
output = ddg_images("rabbit lop", type_image="photo",
                    license_image="public", 
                    max_results=1)
#+end_src

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both
pprint(output[0])
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: {'height': 848,
:  'image': 'https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/12/22/20/27/animals-1104748_1280.jpg',
:  'source': 'Bing',
:  'thumbnail': 'https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.lEqFD_LPmRGbc1GyIUoNygHaE6&pid=Api',
:  'title': 'Flemish Lop Rabbit Very · Free photo on Pixabay',
:  'url': 'https://pixabay.com/en/flemish-lop-rabbit-rabbit-1104748/',
:  'width': 1280}

I thought that the ~output~ argument would change the format of the returned values but it instead seems to direct the values to a file (counting ~stdout~ as a file) and then return the same function output as before. Here's what "print" does'.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both
output = ddg_images("rabbit lop", type_image="photo",
                    license_image="public",
                    output="print",
                    max_results=1)

print(output[0])
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 1. {

: }

* Under The Hood
I was hoping that I'd be able to link to some official documentation to explain what's going on, but from what I can tell [[https://duckduckgo.com/][duckduckgo]] doesn't have an advertised API for its image search, and ~duckduckgo-search~ isn't too heavily documented, but if you look at the ~duckduckgo-search~ code it appears to be using a special token (~vqd~) that you can use to make queries to a special endpoint (https://www.duckduckgo.com/i.js) that you can use to get the search results from, which I couldn't find documented in the duckduckgo-search repository but is mentioned in this [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/59624169][StackOverflow]] answer. I don't know how they figured it out, but using the ~vqd~ parameter and ~o=json~ makes it work pretty much like an API, although the code is also handing pagination so it seems almost like a hybrid web-scraping and API request.

** The VQD

I'll show a request for "rabbit lop" using URL parameters. The actual code is using the [[https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][requests]] library and sends them as a payload dictionary instead, but I thought it might be more familiar to see them as URL parameters (and it makes it so you can copy and paste the output into a browser to see what happens).

The first thing that ~ddg_images~ does is make a POST request to "https://duckduckgo.com/" using the search terms as data (~{q="rabbit lop"}~).

This returns some HTML, within which is some javascript that contains the "vqd" value that we need to pass in as an argument to make the proper search query.

#+begin_src html
<script type="text/JavaScript">
  function nrji() {
    nrj('/t.js?q=rabbit%20lop&l=us-en&s=0&dl=en&ct=US&ss_mkt=us&p_ent=&ex=-1&dfrsp=1')
    DDG.deep.initialize('/d.js?q=rabbit%20lop&l=us-en&s=0&dl=en&ct=US&ss_mkt=us&vqd=3-175223187338608511244788076450682226312-294342034741290420994864096532891255767&p_ent=&ex=-1&sp=1&dfrsp=1');;
  }
  DDG.ready(nrji, 1)
</script>
#+end_src

The "vqd" is one of the arguments to the ~DDG.deep.initialize~ function in the javascript/HTML that's returned from the request and the ~duckduckgo-search~ code extracts it using substring searching, giving us just the vqd.

#+begin_example
vqd=3-175223187338608511244788076450682226312-294342034741290420994864096532891255767
#+end_example

Then a second request is made using the VQD token as one of the parameters along with whatever other parameters you want - in this case we're setting the region (~l=wt-wt~ meaning "no region"), asking that the response be JSON (~o=json~), using the  keywords "rabbit lop" (~q="rabbit lop"~), and turning safe-search off (~p=-1~). To make it work you also need to send the request to a special endpoint ~https://duckduckgo.com/i.js~. So we end up with a request that looks like this:

#+begin_example
https://duckduckgo.com/i.js?q=rabbit+lop&o=json&l=wt-wt&s=0&f=%2C%2C%2Ctype%3Aphoto%2C%2Clicense%3Apublic&p=-1&vqd=3-175223187338608511244788076450682226312-294342034741290420994864096532891255767
#+end_example

The payload to the response is a JSON blob that gets converted by the python code into a dictionary (if you paste the example url into a browser address bar you should be able to see the response).

** Python Translation
The previous section was my attempt to explain to myself more or less how the code works, but I thought it might be easier to understand if we steal some of the code from ~duckduckgo-search~ and modify it to get a single output more or less the way ~ddg_images~ does it..

First we set up our requests session.

#+begin_src python :results none
import requests

HEADERS = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0",
    "Referer": "https://duckduckgo.com/",
}

SESSION = requests.Session()
SESSION.headers.update(HEADERS)
#+end_src

Now we get the ~vqd~ by doing a POST and then searching the returned HTML for the string.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both
payload = dict(q="rabbit lop")

response = SESSION.post("https://duckduckgo.com", data=payload, timeout=10)

PREFIX = b"vqd='"

vqd_index_start = response.content.index(PREFIX) + len(PREFIX)
vqd_index_end = response.content.index(b"'", start=vqd_index_start)

vqd_bytes = response.content[vqd_index_start:vqd_index_end]

# convert it from bytes back to a string before using it as a payload value
vqd = vqd_bytes.decode()
print(vqd)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3-175223187338608511244788076450682226312-294342034741290420994864096532891255767

Now that we have the VQD (whatever it is) we can make our actual search request by building up the payload dictionary and sending the request to duckduckgo.

#+begin_src python :results none
payload["o"] = "json"
payload["l"] = "wt-wt"
payload["s"] = 0
payload["f"] = ",,,type:photo,,license:public"
payload["p"] = -1
payload["vqd"] = vqd

response = SESSION.get("https://duckduckgo.com/i.js", params=payload)
#+end_src

The response contains multiple search results but let's unpack the first one as a demonstration.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both
page_data = response.json()["results"]

row = page_data[0]

output = {
    "title": row["title"],
    "image": row["image"],
    "thumbnail": row["thumbnail"],
    "url": row["url"],
    "height": row["height"],
    "width": row["width"],
    "source": row["source"],
}

SESSION.close()
pprint(output)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: {'height': 848,
:  'image': 'https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/12/22/20/27/animals-1104748_1280.jpg',
:  'source': 'Bing',
:  'thumbnail': 'https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.lEqFD_LPmRGbc1GyIUoNygHaE6&pid=Api',
:  'title': 'Flemish Lop Rabbit Very · Free photo on Pixabay',
:  'url': 'https://pixabay.com/en/flemish-lop-rabbit-rabbit-1104748/',
:  'width': 1280}

The ~ddg_images~ function is doing more than this, but for future reference, here's the basics of what's going on and how the author made the search work.
