#+TITLE: Timer
   Since there are certain code-blocks that take a long time to run I found myself timing everything to see how long things take. This is meant to make it a little easier. But, of course it doesn't, really. Running this on paperspace crashes since I don't want to install espeak on it just to work around it so I'm going to have to do some hacking. The big problem is that the type-hinting will crash it.
